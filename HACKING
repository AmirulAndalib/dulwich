Please follow PEP8 with regard to coding style.

All functionality should be available in pure Python. Optional C
implementations may be written for performance reasons, but should never
replace the Python implementation. The C implementations should follow the
kernel/git coding style.

Where possible please include updates to NEWS along with your improvements.
