Removing a file
===============

Removing a file just means removing its entry in the tree. The blob won't be
deleted because Git tries to preserve the history of your repository.

It's all pythonic::

    >>> del tree["ham"]

  >>> c4 = Commit()
  >>> c4.tree = tree.id
  >>> c4.parents = [commit.id]
  >>> c4.author = c4.committer = author
  >>> c4.commit_time = c4.author_time = int(time())
  >>> c4.commit_timezone = c4.author_timezone = tz
  >>> c4.encoding = "UTF-8"
  >>> c4.message = 'Removing "ham"'

Here we only have the new tree and the commit to save::

    >>> object_store.add_object(spam)
    >>> object_store.add_object(tree)
    >>> object_store.add_object(c4)

And of course update the head::

    >>> repo.refs['refs/heads/master'] = commit.id

If you don't trust me, ask ``git show``. ;-)
