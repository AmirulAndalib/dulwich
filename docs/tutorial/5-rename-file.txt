Renaming a file
===============

Remember you learned that the file name and content are distinct. So renaming
a file is just about associating a blob id to a new name. We won't store more
content, and the operation will be painless.

Let's transfer the blob id from the old name to the new one::

    >>> tree["eggs"] = tree["spam"]
    >>> del tree["spam"]

As usual, we need a commit to store the new tree id::

  >>> c5 = Commit()
  >>> c5.tree = tree.id
  >>> c5.parents = [commit.id]
  >>> c5.author = c5.committer = author
  >>> c5.commit_time = c5.author_time = int(time())
  >>> c5.commit_timezone = c5.author_timezone = tz
  >>> c5.encoding = "UTF-8"
  >>> c5.message = 'Rename "spam" to "eggs"'

As for a deletion, we only have a tree and a commit to save::

    >>> object_store.add_object(tree)
    >>> object_store.add_object(c5)

Remains to make the head bleeding-edge::

    >>> repo.refs['refs/heads/master'] = commit.id

As a last exercise, see how ``git show`` illustrates it.
